# Stock Predictor and Analyzer

## Motivation
Over the past few months, I recently became interested in investing money in stocks and the stock market. The stock market is one possible way to invest hard-earned money. Though there are other ways to invest money, the stock market often provides the highest potential return. Though it seemed like an easy way to make money, I quickly learned that the market was often times volatile, and hard to predict for an investing beginner. That is when I decided to use my programming knowledge, a few online resources, and my desire to learn and apply basic machine learning principles to create a tool. The goal of the tool was to help predict stock prices and easily categorize them in to buy, sell, and hold categories.
