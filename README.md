# Stock Predictor and Analyzer

This is an extremely basic stock predictor and analyzer Python script. It scrapes the web (Yahoo Finance website) for stock ticker information and analyzes the data to predict future stock prices.

## Motivation
Over the past few months, I recently became interested in investing money in stocks and the stock market. The stock market is one possible way to invest hard-earned money. Though there are other ways to invest money, the stock market often provides the highest potential return. Though it seemed like an easy way to make money, I quickly learned that the market was often times volatile, and hard to predict for an investing beginner. That is when I decided to use my programming knowledge, a few online resources, and my desire to learn and apply basic machine learning principles to create a tool. The goal of the tool was to help predict stock prices and easily categorize them in to buy, sell, and hold categories.
